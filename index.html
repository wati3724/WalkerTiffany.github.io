								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Face.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My name is Walker Tiffany. I was born on January 19, 2001, in Anchorage Alaska. My stay in Alaska was short-lived and I moved to Oklahoma a year and a half later. This set the standard for the rest of my life as a military brat. By the time I began college at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2019, I had lived on three continents and moved over half a dozen times. I am currently in my senior year at CU and aim to complete my aerospace engineering degree this May. My major is accompanied by minors in computer science and leadership studies. My post college plans are not yet solidified, but I am hoping to contiue to persue a career in engineering.</p>
								<p>Outside of work I am a Christian, I love sports and the outdoors, and dabble in the world of board gaming. Ultimately, these are places where my love for God and people can be expressed. At church, I have the opportunity to worship my heavenly Father and encourage other Christians in their faith. In the great outdoors, I get to spend time with friends and family exploiting the beauty of creation. Sports and board games provide a way for my fun loving competitive nature to come out, while building bonds with others. I love the life that God has given me and want to share it. Thank you for taking a second to get to know me and I hope we get the chance to connect soon.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/SoupSat.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Freshmen Design Project:</p>
								<p>In my Freshman year design class, I was part of a team that sent a CubeSat to space. Our CubeSat contained sensors that measured the intensity of UV rays through various types of materials. We ended up giving multiple reports on our data and won the freshman engineering symposium.</p> 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/ProBE.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Senior Design Project:</p>
								<p>In my senior year, I am working with a team of 9 other aerospace engineers on an automation project for a battery company in Longmont. We are designing a system that automates their current industry readiness testing for their 8s16p battery, hoping to eliminate the need for a technician to complete this test.</p> 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Constillation.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Asteroids Orbits Project:</p>
								<p>In my Junior-level orbital dynamics class, we had to model the orbits of satellites around an asteroid name "Bennu". Our goal was to orbit our satellites in a constellation that allowed for the best possible observation of the planet. We had to balance this with keeping the cost of our mission as low as possible. Our solution ended up working well and we won the class vote for best presentation.</p> 
								<p>Bottle Rocket:</p>
								<p>In my Sophomore-level rocket class, we had a semester-long project for the creation of a bottle rocket. We had to construct our rocket and use our rudimentary knowledge of rocket propulsion to model how far it would fly. We ended up being within a few percentage points of the actual distance it flew on test day.</p>	
								<p>Airfoil Model:</p>
								<p>In my Junior-level Aerodynamics class, we were tasked with modeling the flow over an airfoil with the use of vertices. Our model summed up the flow created by vortices of varying strength to model the flow over a given airfoil geometry. We also universalized our model to work for any airfoil geometry using the standard NACA naming system.</p>

						<!-- Interests -->
							<article id="extra">
								<h2 class="major">Interests</h2>
   								<p>Outside of my academics I am actively involved in a campus ministry called the Navigators. Our model is to "Know Christ, to make him known, and to help others do the same." Through this program I have had the opportunity to not only grow in my faith, but be in a community with other college students who take their Christian faith seriously. Through Navs, I have had the privilege of helping lead a semester long men's bible study and am currently a small group leader for a habits study we are going through. The Navigators have been a great place for me to engage in community and grow in my walk with Christ. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/SummerCamp2022.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><i>Picture of my campers and the other counselors at summer camp. My head is barley vissible to the right of the shark.</i></p>
								<p>During the summers, I spend my time in Colorado Springs. There, I helped with the youth group at my church and got to be a counselor at our highschool summer camp. I love the kids I get to be a mentor to through youth group and enjoy the chance to get to see them grow into more mature Christians. I think it is as important to invest my time in those younger than me as it is to seek out older mentors to guide me. My church's youth group has been a great place to help me do both and I am looking forward to returning to it this summer. </p>
								<p>Outside of church, I was a competitive runner and soccer player in highschool. Since coming to college I have continued my love for sports and competition through CUâ€™s intramural program. My friends and I are currently playing in four different sports this quarter and loving it. It is a great way to stay in shape as well as bond with the people I am on teams with. I think God gives us athletics as a way to connect and have fun with other people. I am appreciative of the opportunity I have had to do that in college and am already looking ahead to joining a soccer league when I graduate and move back home.</p>
